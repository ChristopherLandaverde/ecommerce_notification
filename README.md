# ecommerce_notification


Develop an E-Commerce Scraper that would scrape a website but also notify me when an item was in stock.

I've hated shopping for e-commerce fitness products throughout this entire quarantine.

You would have either. 

a) price gouging.
b) selling out
c) purchasing equipment from a less popular company.

And fitness newsletters are terrible; by the time you received it, the item is more than likely out of stock.


Developed a scraper using scrapy that would let me know when specific products (bumper plates) would switch from out-of-stock towards in-stock to improve my chances of purchasing these products the minute they are in stock.

I have this currently running on a cron job; wish me luck!
